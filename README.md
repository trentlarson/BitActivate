==========

for Money2020 Hackathon

Remaining tasks:
- multiple features: see cost difference, display difference, only one turned on at a time
-- the isActive checks in sampleapp index.html will not work since they're never being set
-- remove hard-coded FEATURE_SET[0] references
-- optimization: make one call to library for all features (instead of calling one-by-one, at startup)
- use new address before demo (so there's no chance of a chain API result that's too large)
- get address from a judge during demo?  :-)
- HD wallet?
- for multiple features: store in the local file; may change to array result for some methods
- programmatic config for client app
